## Introduction
The repository contains some example code to get you started. 

You may use this README for your coding report as per Task 5.

## Setup

To run the `index.js` file you'll first need to use `cd C4A` to change the directory to my working folder.

## General Overview

The website is designed to best portray a chat application where each user has a profile, biography, and info page. 

There is one _"default"_ user, which is supposed to represent me and my interests. A mock profile if you will of me. 

## Problems I Ran Into 

Some of the problems I ran into while creating the website were almost all related to Javascript.

Javascript is definitely my weakest point as I feel I have almost mastered HTML and can google my way through CSS, but with Javascript, I need more practice.
