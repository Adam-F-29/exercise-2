        <p>Hello! I am a first year undergraduate student at the University of Aberdeen, studying Language and Linguistics, however I have interests in many other areas too.</p>
        <p>Within Linguistics my interests lie mainly in syntax, phonology, and sociolinguistics. Syntax and phonology have always interested me, at least since high school, as I am fascinated by how we can describe rules and ways of speaking that are innate to the language we speak. We are able to converse with people we have never met before and know what they are saying, and we do all this while not even being conscious of the rules that we follow.</p>
        <p>Sociolinguistics is as revelent today as it has ever been. Sociolinguistics combines sociology and linguistics, specifically looking into how the language we speak has a social impact on who we are and how we are percieved.</p>
        <p>Related to sociolinguistics, lies my interest in Sociology generally speaking. I really enjoyed the sociology module I did last semester, where we looked at how different aspects of our lives from our online presence to our gender indentity can be used to show the version of ourselves that we want others seeing. Most notably I learnt of this idea of 'social actors' -- the idea that we are all merely actors in the world with a <i>backstage</i> and <i>frontstage</i> identity, and how we are able to change roles depending on the circumstance.</p>
        <p>I also have an interest in Philosophical logic. I am interested in how we can create formal proofs for the arguments we make, and ways to get statistically the best result given our premises. This way of formulating logic was actually how early forms of computer logic got established.</p>
        <p>Even at the start of this semester -- my first view of logic -- I thought that it had a striking resemblence to logic gates in computer science. To learn that the two are connected I thought was a nice way to connect philosophy to one of my other interests, computer science.</p>
        <p>Other than the Web Development I am enrolled in currently, I have had little exposure to computer science as a whole. I have learnt basic Python in my spare time during the later years of high school and really enjoyed that, but this semester, learning Web Development has been a lovely change of pace. I love creating websites and testing different styles with CSS. JavaScript is also really fun to learn and I feel my prior knowledge in Python has helped me greately, however I still have a lot of work to do to improve in JS.</p>
        <p>Outwith academics, I have many hobbies from playing guitar to playing board games in social settings, to learning Spanish.</p>
        <p>I have really enjoyed this Web Development course and will definitely be continuing to practice and learn in my spare time as a hobby.</p>
